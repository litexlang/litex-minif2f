# IMO 1973 Problem 3: If x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + ax + 1 = 0 has a real root,
# then a^2 + b^2 >= 4/5
# This is a complex problem requiring polynomial analysis and optimization

# Technical dependencies needed:
# 1. Polynomial root analysis
# 2. Substitution techniques (note the palindromic structure)
# 3. Inequality optimization

# Approach: The polynomial is palindromic. Let y = x + 1/x, then we can
# reduce the degree. The condition for real roots leads to constraints on a and b.
