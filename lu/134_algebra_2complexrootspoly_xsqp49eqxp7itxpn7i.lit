# Problem: Show that for any complex number x, x^2 + 49 = (x + 7i)(x - 7i)
# Technical dependency needed: Complex numbers with imaginary unit i

# Note: This requires complex number support in Litex
# For now, we'll create a draft assuming complex numbers are available

claim:
    # For any complex number x: x^2 + 49 = (x + 7i)(x - 7i)
    # TODO: Complete formalization once complex number support is available
    prove:
        # Expand: (x + 7i)(x - 7i) = x^2 + 7ix - 7ix - (7i)^2
        # = x^2 - 49i^2
        # Since i^2 = -1: x^2 - 49(-1) = x^2 + 49
        
        # TODO: Formalize once complex number operations are available
        know # x^2 + 49 = (x + 7i)(x - 7i)
