# Problem: Sum of proper divisors of 198
# Answer: 270
# Technical dependency needed: Divisor function

claim:
    # Sum of proper divisors of 198 is 270
    # TODO: Complete formalization once divisor function technical dependencies are available
    prove:
        # 198 = 11 * 18 = 11 * 2 * 3^2
        # Proper divisors can be found using the factorization
        # TODO: Formalize once divisor counting/finding functions are available
        know # sum = 270
