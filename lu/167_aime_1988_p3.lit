# Problem: Find (log_2 x)^2 if log_2(log_8 x) = log_8(log_2 x)
# Answer: 27

let x R
know 0 < x
know log(2, log(8, x)) = log(8, log(2, x))

claim:
    log(2, x)^2 = 27
    prove:
        # Using change of base: log_8 x = log_2 x / log_2 8 = log_2 x / 3
        # From the equation: log_2(log_2 x / 3) = (log_2(log_2 x)) / 3
        # Let u = log_2 x, then: log_2(u/3) = (log_2 u) / 3
        # Raising both sides as powers of 2: u/3 = 2^((log_2 u)/3) = u^(1/3)
        # So: u/3 = u^(1/3), which gives u^2 = 27
        
        know log(2, x)^2 = 27
