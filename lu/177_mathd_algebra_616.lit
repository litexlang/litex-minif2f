# Problem: f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1, g(x) = x - 1, find f(g(1))
# Answer: 1

let fn f(x R) R
let fn g(x R) R
know forall x R: f(x) = x^3 + 2 * x + 1
know forall x R: g(x) = x - 1

claim:
    f(g(1)) = 1
    prove:
        g(1) = 1 - 1 = 0
        f(g(1)) = f(0)
        f(0) = 0^3 + 2 * 0 + 1 = 1
        f(g(1)) = 1
