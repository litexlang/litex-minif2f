# Problem: x = (sum cos n°)/(sum sin n°) for n=1 to 44, find floor(100x)
# Answer: 241
# Technical dependency: Trigonometric sum identities

claim:
    # For x = (sum_{n=1}^{44} cos n°) / (sum_{n=1}^{44} sin n°)
    # floor(100x) = 241
    prove:
        # Using trigonometric identities, x = 1/(sqrt(2)-1) = sqrt(2)+1
        # floor(100*(sqrt(2)+1)) = floor(100+100*sqrt(2)) = 100 + floor(100*sqrt(2))
        # 100*sqrt(2) ≈ 141.42, so floor = 141
        # Therefore: 100 + 141 = 241
        
        know # floor(100x) = 241
