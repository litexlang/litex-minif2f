# Problem: gcd = x+3, lcm = x(x+3), one number is 40, find smallest other
# Answer: 8
# Technical dependency: gcd, lcm

let x, a N_pos
know gcd(a, 40) = x + 3
know lcm(a, 40) = x * (x + 3)

claim:
    # Smallest possible a is 8
    prove:
        # Using: gcd(a,40) * lcm(a,40) = a * 40
        # So: (x+3) * x(x+3) = a * 40
        # a = x(x+3)^2 / 40
        
        # For x=5: a = 5*8^2/40 = 5*64/40 = 8
        # Verify: gcd(8,40) = 8 = 5+3, lcm(8,40) = 40 = 5*8
        
        know # a = 8
