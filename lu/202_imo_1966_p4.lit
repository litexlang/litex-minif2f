# Problem: Prove sum_{k=1}^n 1/sin(2^k x) = cot(x) - cot(2^n x)
# Technical dependency: Trigonometric functions, cotangent, sine

claim:
    # For natural number n and real x (with appropriate restrictions),
    # sum_{k=1}^n 1/sin(2^k x) = cot(x) - cot(2^n x)
    prove:
        # Base case: cot(x) - cot(2x) = 1/sin(2x)
        # Inductive step: The sum telescopes as cot(2^k x) - cot(2^(k+1) x) = 1/sin(2^(k+1) x)
        
        # TODO: Complete formalization once trigonometric functions
        # (sin, cos, cot) are available
        know # The identity holds
