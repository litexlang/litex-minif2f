# Problem: Amy and Betty have 20 apples total, Amy has 3 times Betty's. How many more does Amy have?
# Answer: 10

let a, b N_pos
know a + b = 20
know a = 3 * b

claim:
    a - b = 10
    prove:
        a + b = 20
        a = 3 * b
        3 * b + b = 20
        4 * b = 20
        b = 5
        a = 3 * b = 15
        a - b = 15 - 5 = 10
