# Problem: Solve (x+1)/(x-1) = (x-2)/(x+2)
# Answer: x = 0

let x R
know x != 1
know x != -2
know (x + 1) / (x - 1) = (x - 2) / (x + 2)

claim:
    x = 0
    prove:
        (x + 1) / (x - 1) = (x - 2) / (x + 2)
        (x + 1) * (x + 2) = (x - 2) * (x - 1)
        x^2 + 3*x + 2 = x^2 - 3*x + 2
        3*x + 2 = -3*x + 2
        6*x = 0
        x = 0
