# Problem: Solve 5n ≡ 8 (mod 17)
# Answer: n ≡ 5 (mod 17)

let n N
know (5 * n) % 17 = 8

claim:
    n % 17 = 5
    prove:
        # 8 ≡ 25 (mod 17), so 5n ≡ 25 (mod 17)
        # Since gcd(5,17)=1, we can divide by 5: n ≡ 5 (mod 17)
        
        8 % 17 = 8
        25 % 17 = 8
        5 * n % 17 = 8
        5 * n % 17 = 25 % 17
        know 5 * n ≡ 25 (mod 17)
        know gcd(5, 17) = 1
        n % 17 = 5
