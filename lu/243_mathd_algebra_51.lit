# Problem: Larry and Lenny have $35 total, Larry has 2/5 of Lenny's, how much more does Lenny have?
# Answer: 15

claim:
    forall a, b R_pos:
        a + b = 35
        a = 2 / 5 * b
        =>:
            b - a = 15
    prove:
        2 / 5 * b + b = 35 = (2 / 5 + 1) * b = (7 / 5) * b
        b = (7 / 5) * b / (7 / 5) = 35 / (7 / 5) = 25
        a = 2 / 5 * b = 2 / 5 * 25 = 10
        b - a = 25 - 10 = 15
