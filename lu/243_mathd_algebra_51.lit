# Problem: Larry and Lenny have $35 total, Larry has 2/5 of Lenny's, how much more does Lenny have?
# Answer: 15

let a, b R
know 0 < a
know 0 < b
know a + b = 35
know a = (2/5) * b

claim:
    b - a = 15
    prove:
        a + b = 35
        a = (2/5) * b
        (2/5) * b + b = 35
        (7/5) * b = 35
        b = 25
        a = (2/5) * 25 = 10
        b - a = 25 - 10 = 15
