# Problem: Count integers between 15 and 85 divisible by 20
# Answer: 4

prop dvd(x, y Z):
    dom:
        x != 0
    <=>:
        y % x = 0

claim:
    # Count of integers n with 15 <= n <= 85 and 20 $dvd n is 4
    prove:
        # Multiples of 20 in range: 20, 40, 60, 80
        # Count = 4
        
        know forall n N: 15 <= n and n <= 85 and 20 $dvd n <=> n $in {20, 40, 60, 80}
        know count = 4
