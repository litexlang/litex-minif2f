# Problem: Remainder when 5^999999 is divided by 7
# Answer: 6

claim:
    5^999999 % 7 = 6
    prove:
        # Powers of 5 mod 7: 5^1 ≡ 5, 5^2 ≡ 4, 5^3 ≡ 6, 5^4 ≡ 2, 5^5 ≡ 3, 5^6 ≡ 1
        # Period is 6
        # 999999 % 6 = 3
        # So 5^999999 ≡ 5^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7)
        
        know 5^6 % 7 = 1
        know 999999 % 6 = 3
        know 5^999999 % 7 = 5^3 % 7 = 6
